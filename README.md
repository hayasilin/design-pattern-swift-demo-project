# Design Pattern Swift Demo Project

[Here is Tradition Chinese version 繁體中文版本](https://github.com/hayasilin/design-pattern-swift-demo-project/blob/master/README_zh-Hant.md)

This is a demo project called **Sport Store** and I make it in Xcode 11 according to Adam Freeman's [Pro Design Patterns in Swift](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Swift-Adam-Freeman/dp/148420395X) to demostrate how to implement design patterns in a real iOS project. Enjoy it.

## Introduction

I didn't follow 100% from the book's code, I made it my way with my understanding. You can check my commits to see how I implement each design pattern one by one.

In addition, I didn't implement all design pattern from the book, becasue some of them don't have implementation example from the book, or it's not suitable to implement in this demo project.

**The design patter that didn't implement in demo project:**
- Object pool pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Flyweight pattern
- Strategy pattern
- Visitor pattern
- Template method pattern

**Still you can [check here](https://github.com/hayasilin/design-pattern-swift) to learn them.**
