# Design Pattern Swift Demo Project

This is a demo project called **Sport Store** and I make it in Xcode 11 according to Adam Freeman's [Pro Design Patterns in Swift](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Swift-Adam-Freeman/dp/148420395X) to demostrate how to implement design patterns in a real iOS project. Enjoy it.

## Introduction

You can check my commits to see how to implement each design pattern one by one.
